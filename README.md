## Introduction

[Baidu cloud push](http://push.baidu.com/) is a Chinese cloud service that you can use to send push notifications to mobile devices.

As Google Play and FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) are not available in China, it is necessary to use different app stores and push services. Baidu is one of them, and currently used by [Azure Notification Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/notification-hubs/) & [Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).

Baidu Cloud Push can be deployed to both Google/AOSP devices.

## Installation

Installation instruction is available at [project's wiki](https://github.com/xyfoo/Baidu.Android.PushService/wiki).
